# Feature Ideas

## Version 1.0
- Make sure transitions last at least X milliseconds
- Make sure the footer is not blocking the content on small screens
- Show a loading indicator during AJAX calls, increase AJAX timeout
- Make different days of the week more visually distinctive
- Show the start and end date of the current week
- Week-Reset button
  - Is confusing, but a nice feature
  - Maybe get a better, more comprehensible icon
  - Decide if it should be disabled when in current week already -> yes, probably
- Use offline data for testing

- Add a week-picker for week selection (click on current week button)
- Add a sliding animation (left/ right) when changing the week
